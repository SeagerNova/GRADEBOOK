# This is a project I made at University. Its purpose is to simulate a gradebook scenario in which a teacher would be able to input their students grades by module and view them collectively at the end. Additionally, the user can specify which module results they would like to see.

Here is the feedback I recieved from my module convenor:
Report:

A description of the classes is provided;

UML diagram corresponds to the code; examples of  output  are presented, there is also a short  evaluation section;

Code:

Excellent use of OOP principles; very good validation of user's inputs;

A user is given an option to print  selected table(s)without re-entering marks;

MARK: 100%
